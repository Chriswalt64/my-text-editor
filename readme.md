## Overview

This is a project I started to learn not just Electron, but also just html/css/js altogether. 

## How To Use
**This is really not usable, so dont use this to actually do anything meaningful**

To clone and run this application, you'll need [Git](https://git-scm.com) and [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) (which comes with [npm](http://npmjs.com)) installed on your computer. From your command line:

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/Chriswalt64/my-text-editor.git

# Go into the repository
$ cd my-text-editor

# Install dependencies
$ npm install

# Run the app
$ npm start
```

> **Note**
> If you're using Linux Bash for Windows, [see this guide](https://www.howtogeek.com/261575/how-to-run-graphical-linux-desktop-applications-from-windows-10s-bash-shell/) or use `node` from the command prompt.
